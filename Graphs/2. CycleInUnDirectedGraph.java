Question : 
Given an Undirected Graph. Check whether it contains a cycle or not. Complete the method isCyclic() which takes the Graph and the number of vertices and edges as 
inputs and returns true if the given undirected graph contains any cycle. Else, it returns false. Its arguments are two integers 'N' and 'M' which denotes the 
no of vertices and no of edges respectively. And 'Mâ€™ pairs u and v denoting that there is an edge from u to v and returns 1 if there is a cycle else it should 
return 0.

Explanation : 
We can detect cycle in undirected graph using DFS (Depth First Search) technique. DFS is done for every unvisited vertex. A cycle is present in a graph if there 
is a back edge present in the graph. A back edge is an edge that is joining a node to itself or one of its ancestors in the tree produced by DFS. So in order to 
find the back edge we keep a visited array and if there is a back edge found to any visited node then a cycle is present and thus we return true. 

Steps :
a) Create a graph with given number of edges and vertices.
b) Create a recursive function isCyclic() that takes current vertex, visited array and a parent node. 
c) First we make the current node as visited. Then we find all vertices that are not visited and adjacent to the current node. We recursively call isCyclic() for those vertices. If it returns true, we return 1. 
d) Suppose the adjacent node is not a parent but is already visited then we return true. 
e) We create another function checkCyclic() which calls the isCyclic() function for all the vertices and if any of them return true, we return 1. If for all vertices it returns false, we return 0.

Output :

Time Complexity : O(V + E) as we are doing DFS traversal using adjacency list where V is number of vertices and E is number of edges in graph. 

Space Complexity : O(V) as we are creating a visited array with length equal to number of vertices.

Question : 
Given a boolean 2D matrix (0-based index), find whether there is path from (0,0) to (x,y) and if there is one path, print the minimum no of steps needed to reach 
it, else print -1 if the destination is not reachable. You may move in only four direction ie up, down, left and right. The path can only be created out of a cell 
if its value is 1. Complete the function for implementing this. Arguments are two integers n and m denoting the size of the matrix, an n*m matrix and two integers x and y denoting 
the index of the destination. Print the min no of steps needed to reach the destination.

Constraints:
1<=n,m<=20

Explanation : 
We can solve this problem using Lee's Algorithm. It follows the Breath First Search (BFS) approach. 
Steps :
a) Create an empty queue and enqueue the source cell having a distance 0 from the source (itself) and mark it as visited. 
b) Loop till queue is empty and do the following :
       i) Dequeue the front node
       ii) If the popped node is the destination node, then return its distance
       iii) Otherwise, for each of the four adjacent cells of the current cell, enqueue each valid cell with +1 diatance and mark them as visited
c) If all the queue nodes are processed and the destination is not reached, then return -1.

Note tht in BFS, all cells having the shortest path as 1 are visited first, followed by their adjacent cells having the shortest path as 1 + 1 = 2 and so on.. 
So if we reach any node in BFS, its shortest path is one more than the shortest path of the parent. So, the destination cell's first occurance gives us the 
result and we can stop our search there. It is impossible that the shortest path exists from some other cell for which we haven't reached the given node yet. 
If such path were possible, we would have already explored it.
